# Food-ordering-system
A simple Python-based food ordering system developed using basic control structures
The program displays a menu of food items, allows users to select items and quantities, calculates the total cost, and handles incorrect inputs gracefully. It simulates a real-world ordering interaction in a restaurant or food kiosk environment.

## 📋 Features

- Menu display with food items and prices
- User input for selecting menu items
- Quantity selection with input validation
- Calculates total bill based on item and quantity
- Option to exit the menu
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## 🧠 Python Concepts Learned

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

- Functions for code modularity (display_menu, get_user_choice, etc.)
- While loops for repeated user interaction
- If-else statements for flow control
- Try-except blocks for error handling
- Dictionaries and integers for menu data and cost calculations
- Input validation using .isdigit() and value checking
  
🔄 Future Improvements
	•	Add more menu items and categories
	•	Introduce pricing discounts or meal combos
	•	Store order history in a file or database
	•	Allow for multiple item selection in a single run
	•	Add confirmation before placing an order
	•	Display total cost for multiple items

## ▶ How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the .ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or Google Colab.
3. Run the cells to interact with the food ordering system in your terminal.

## 🧑‍💻 Example Use

```
